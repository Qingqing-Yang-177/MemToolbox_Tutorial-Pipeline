% MemToolbox beta
% 
% The MemToolbox is a collection of MATLAB functions that is designed for
% analyzing data from visual working memory studies. In particular, it
% contains a variety of functions that make it easier to fit models to
% continuous report data (as made popular by Wilken & Ma, 2004 and Zhang
% & Luck, 2008), as well as to plot these model fits and understand where
% they capture the data and where they fail to capture the data. The
% toolbox contains a number of models built in -- including those made
% popular by Zhang & Luck (2008), and Bays et al. (2009), among others.
%
% To install the toolbox, just add the MemToolbox folder and all of the
% subfolders to your path. Setup.m is designed to do this for you.
% 
% If you want to acknowledge use of this software when you publish your
% research, you might say something like, "Data analysis was performed
% in MATLAB using the MemToolbox (citation)."
