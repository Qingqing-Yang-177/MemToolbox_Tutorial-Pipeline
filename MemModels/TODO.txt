Maybe combine all the "StandardMixtureModel*.m" into one .m that takes extra, named parameters where you can saw you want bias or not, and want Kappa or SD? (with defaults of no bias and SD?) -- sort of like how you have the higher-order model now. I guess we could move all these "helper" models (e.g., StudentsTModel, SplinesModel, etc) to a subfolder, and only have the main folder have the main .m files that people should actually call (e.g., InfiniteScaleModel.m), which then returns the correct sub-model....

Also, there is a mixture here between theoretical constructs as names (SlotModel.m; QuantalDeathModel.m); literal descriptions of the math (SplinesModel.m; StudentsTModel.m); and halfway (StandardMixtureModel.m; ExponentialDecayModel.m; NoGuessingModel.m).  Not sure if I think we should go theory (e.g., StandardMixtureModel.m -> SlotsPlusAveragingModel.m or ZhangLuckModel.m) or math/components (e.g., VonMisesPlusUniformModel.m; HigherOrderSplinesModel.m; HigherOrderGammaModel.m). Mixing is probably wrong, and either way the help functions in each should have a clear statement of both math & theory...
