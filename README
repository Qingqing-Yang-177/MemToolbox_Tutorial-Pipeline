MemToolbox beta.

The MemToolbox is a collection of MATLAB functions for modeling visual working memory. In support of its goal to provide a full suite of data analysis tools, the toolbox includes implementations of popular models of visual working memory, real and simulated data sets, Bayesian and maximum likelihood estimation procedures for fitting models to data, visualizations of data and fit, validation routines, model comparison metrics, and experiment scripts. The MemToolbox is released under a BSD license and is freely available.

If you want to acknowledge use of this software when you publish your
research, you might say something like, "Data analysis was performed
in MATLAB using the MemToolbox (citation)."

Dependencies:
1. The Statistics Toolbox (http://www.mathworks.com/products/statistics/) is needed for all of the major functionality of the toolbox.
2. The Psychophysics Toolbox (http://psychtoolbox.org) is needed only for the experiment scripts in MemExperiments.
