{"google":"UA-34069478-1","body":"### Get started using the MemToolbox.\r\nThe MemToolbox is a collection of MATLAB functions for modeling visual working memory. In support of its goal to provide a full suite of data analysis tools, the toolbox includes implementations of popular models of visual working memory, real and simulated data sets, Bayesian and maximum likelihood estimation procedures for fitting models to data, visualizations of data and fit, validation routines, model comparison metrics, and experiment scripts. The MemToolbox is released under a BSD license and is freely available.\r\n\r\nDownload the toolbox using the links above.\r\n\r\nGet started by reading the tutorial, which is included in the toolbox and accessible through the command\r\n\r\n```\r\nMemFit\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to acknowledge use of this software when you publish your\r\nresearch, you might say something like, \r\n\r\n```\r\nData analysis was performed in MATLAB using the MemToolbox (citation).\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with the toolbox?
